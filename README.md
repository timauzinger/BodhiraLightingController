# BodhiraLightingController
This is a touchdesigner-based software to live-control the kinetic light installation "Bodhira". The Project provides a UserInterface and allows to controll lighting effects and color as well as movement states in a live setup e.g. live-music, audiovisual performances, etc.

## Overview & UI

Bodhira's Lighting Effects are controlled using 2 Layers of 2D-Texture Effects. There are the Base-Effects intended to be used for longer display and Overlay-Effects intended fo short bursts of excitement. Additionally there are Color-Presets added wich can also be shifted towars the desired Color or for more expression possibilities. 

These 2D-Texture Effects as well al Motor-Movement and additional Effects are controlled by a global Tap-Tempo wich can be Tapped-In at any time.

Additionall Global-Effects: 
* Beat-Enahncer:  adds global Brightness-Effect matched to the Beat
* Auto-ColorShifter: adds a aubtle but continous change in color
* Feedback: adds a Feedback-Effect wich smoothes out textures, enhances their Brightness and is generally a good practice for transitions and just playing around

There are other Settings regarding the Motor and fadeTimes of the Effects wich should be pretty much self explanatory. 

Here you can have a look at the UI wich displays all controlable values:



As an additional Feature Audio can be inserted to be able to use a custom AutoPilot. This then changes the Base-Effect and Color as well as Overlay-Effects according to the Audio-Input. **Note:*** the thresholds for Kick and Snare detection have to be adjusted to make a good detection for the actual Song.
